            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>Strange and Terrible NEWS from <hi>Alton in Hamp-Shire,</hi> Being a full and true Account of a Dreadful Tempest Which happened by <hi>Thunder and Lightning,</hi> December 19th. 1686.</head>
            <p>AMongst all those Varieties of Natural Accidents, that either cause our Fear or occasion our Amazement, there is certainly nothing that more contributes to both of them than Thunder and Lightning: In the rest of the methods that the Almighty pleases to evidence His Power to the World, there are more manifest signs of His mercy and mildness than His Anger and Displeasure, as the Reader may find in the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>On the Nineteenth of <hi>December,</hi> 1686. at <hi>Alton</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened such a Tempest, that for the strangeness of its circumstances can scarce be parallel'd in any History; whether we consider the violence of the Storm, or its duration, or the favourable <hi>Exit</hi> it made. On Sunday when the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Minister of the Parish was towards the latter end of his Prayer before Sermon, it grew on a sudden so exceeding dark that the People could hardly discern one another, and immediately after happened such flashes of Lightning that the whole Church seemed to be in a bright Flame; the surprize of the Congregation was exceeding great, especially when two Balls of Fire that made their entry at the Eastern Wall, pass'd through the body of the Church, leaving behind 'em so great a Smoke, and smell of Brimstone, as is scarce able to be exprest. The People endeavour'd all they could to get out of the Church, and as it generally happens in such occasions, the Throng and Pressing at the Door was so great and tumultuous, that it was a considerable time before they got out; some of them fainted away in the Church, as namely the Clerk, who, when he came to himself, cry'd out, <hi>Good People where be yee;</hi> some Swounded in the Church-yard, and others in their own Houses, so great an impression had the Tempest made on them. In short, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, the cry of Women and Children was exceeding affrightful; but to the everlasting remembrance of so strange an event, none were killed, <hi>Lightning and Thunder cannot go a hairs breadth beyond the Almighty's Commission; Winds and Tempests fulfil His Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:206783:3"/>
            <p>Thus for the Relation of the Tempest in General; come we now to the particular Damages it wrought: it broke a hole through the Tower about the bigness of a Cannon-Bullet-hole, and went away by the brim of the great Bell; it melted above sixty foot of Wire, and passing down into the Clock-room, removed several Boards, and threw a Stone from off the top of a Pillar down among the People, making at the same time as great a noise as the largest Piece of Ordnance in <hi>England.</hi> It has shatter'd and broke the Windows all round the Church, and likewise a very substantial strong Door that goes into the Tower. Also it came in at a Door upon the Leads, shaking down a great part of the Wall, and setting (as 'tis supposed) the middle Lost on Fire, which by the timely care of the People was immediately quench'd and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. The Weather-Cock was carried quite away, and the Hand and Boords belonging to the Clock fell among the Congregation. Several Houses in. <hi>Alton</hi> were so extreamly shook with the violence of the Storm, that the People ran out of Doors, fearing their Houses would fall upon their Heads. <hi>William Hamman</hi> a Shooe-maker had his Head broke, as likewise <hi>Joseph Esments.</hi> The Minister (whose name is Mr. <hi>Henry Butler,</hi> and who justifies the truth of the whole Relation) had his Eye-brows singed with the Lightning; his Eyes were extreamly sore by the burning that happened; as several others of the Parish, that shared with him in this unfortunate Accident. The Wall behind the Pulpit has suffered much damage; the Steeple was set on Fire, which was soon extinguished by the industry of the Townsmen. To give you the words of a Gentleman that had the Curiosity to go and view the Ruins some few daies afterwards; <hi>I never in my life</hi> (saies he) <hi>saw a Sight so dreadful and amazing; and found my self extreamly concern'd to see the Walls (some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are six or eight Foot wide and square) shatter'd and rent after such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal manner; I touched the Wall about the Breach, and the Stones crumbled under my Fingers. The Thunder-Clap put the People in such a Consternation, that few of them were able to give a satisfactory account of the matter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To conclude, as we have great reason to admire the infinite goodness and mercy of the Lord upon this occasion; (not one single person being killed, tho some were wounded) so we ought to apply the case home to our selves, and by a timely quitting our sinful courses, avert those Judgments that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise will unavoidably fall upon us. Some of our Neighbouring Nations (as the <hi>Gazette</hi> has inform'd us) have sufficiently smarted under Heavens displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The better part of <hi>Friezeland</hi> lies covered with the Water: whole Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Towns swept away by the Deluge; and some part of the Castle of St. <hi>Angelo</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> carried by the force of the Inundation. Let Atheists and Hypocrites beware in time, and return to the performance of those Duties, which they are obliged to do as men, and as Christians: For those that will not listen to the Voice of the Lord in His Scriptures, shall hear, against their wills, His Voice in Thunder; and those that are not to be reduced by the Almighties Clemency, must be reclaimed by a Judgment.</p>
